<h3>RLPark Java Archive (JAR)</h3>
RLPark Java Archive is available at the following url:<br/>
<a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~degris/rlpark.jar">http://www.ualberta.ca/~degris/rlpark.jar</a><br/>
The source code should be included in the jar. If not, it is a bug.

	</li>
	<li>Select the plugins you want (if you don't know what you want, select everything)<br/>
